# DLAI-ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-for-Developers
This course, "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers," focuses on prompt engineering techniques for developers. It is taught by Isa Fulford, a member of OpenAI's technical staff, known for her work on the ChatGPT Retrieval plugin. The course emphasizes using large language models (LLMs) as a developer tool through API calls to build software applications quickly. The instructor highlights the underappreciated potential of LLMs in this context. The course covers prompting best practices for software development, common use cases (summarizing, inferring, transforming, expanding), and building a chatbot with an LLM. The instructor also discusses two types of LLMs: base LLMs, trained to predict the next word, and instruction-tuned LLMs, trained to follow instructions. The focus of the course is on instruction-tuned LLMs, which are recommended for most practical applications due to their helpfulness and safety. The course aims to provide practical guidance and spark creativity in utilizing LLMs for various applications.
